# Price-prediction
This project aims to predict the price of a Avacoado fruit based on historical data and other relevant factors.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data on the price of the product or service, as well as other relevant factors such as time, location, and demand. The dataset is stored in a CSV file and is available in the data directory.

Dependencies
The project uses Python 3.7 and requires the following dependencies:

Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Modify the config.py file to configure the parameters of the model.
Run the main.py script to train the model and generate predictions.
Model
The model used in this project is a logistic regression model that is trained on the historical data to predict future prices. The model takes into account various factors such as time, location, and demand to make its predictions.

Results
The results of the model are evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE). The results are displayed in the console and are also saved in a text file in the results directory.
